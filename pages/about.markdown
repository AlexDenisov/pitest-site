# About PIT

PIT is largely the work of myself - Henry Coles, a software developer based in Edinburgh, but has benefited from contributions from numerous others. 

If you'd like to get in touch I can be contacted at **henry@pitest.org**. Please do not use this address for support requests - these should be sent to the google group where they'll getter a better/faster response.

Development has been kindly supported by the following companies

* [YourKit] - Provide free access to their full featured Java profiler
* [Sonatype] - Host the maven repo and provide syncing across to maven central
