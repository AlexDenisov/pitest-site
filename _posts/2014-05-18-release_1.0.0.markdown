PIT 1.0.0 has now been released and is available from github and maven central.

<!-- more -->

After four years of development the pitest code base has morphed from being an experimental system for running distributing tests across clusters of machines, into the first mutation testing system to achieve wide scale deployment in real teams. 

Although I have no concrete figures, I believe pitest has been the most widely used mutation testing system for Java for some time now. Part of the reason that pitest has become popular is that it has released regularly and often, fixing bugs, adding features and chasing performance gains. 

This is the **34th** release. 

There is nothing particularly special about it (although it does include some cool things), but I felt that it was about time that pitest had release numbers that reflect its maturity. So rather than being 0.34, this is the **1.0.0** release and from now on pitest will adopt [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/)


See [1.0.0](https://github.com/hcoles/pitest/releases/tag/pitest-parent-1.0.0) for details of what's actually in the release.

Thanks to everyone who has submitted bug reports, fixes and features over the years. Please keep them coming.
