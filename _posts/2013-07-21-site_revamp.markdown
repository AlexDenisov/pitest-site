The pitest.org website has had a bit of a revamp with a new look based on [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) and a logo kindly provided by Ling Yeung.

<!-- more -->

For anyone wondering why the logo consists of a canary wearing a helmet it's a reference to a form of testing dating back to 1911. Pit canaries were taken down mines to provide feedback to miners by falling dead when they encountered toxic gas. Pit canaries continued to be used in British mines until they were replaced by electronic gas detectors in 1986.
