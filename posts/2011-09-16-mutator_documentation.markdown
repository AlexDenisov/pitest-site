Stefan Penndorf has contributed some great work documenting PIT's mutation operators. <!-- more -->

This is now been merged into the site at [mutation operators](/quickstart/mutators/). He has also provided some improvements to the test cases 
which now provide a clearer description of the behaviour.

I'd to say a big thanks to Stefan for his effort, and hope we can get some more from him in the future as he really has done a excellent job.
